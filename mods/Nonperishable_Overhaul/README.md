# Nonperishable Overhaul, a mod for Catacylsm: Dark Days Ahead and Cataclysm: Bright Nights

This mod has a very simple premise: a general overhaul of spoilage for food that is obstinately non-perishable. Main effect is reverting the spoilage times added to a broad swath of shelf-stable food. Reasons why include:

1. Shelf lives seem to be based on worst-case scenarios, which is ONLY realistic if you give players the ability to store the food in proper containers (which did not happen).
2. Conversion of half-rotten ingredients into half-rotten food is blind to whether an individual type of food would be sterilized in the process, and whether this therefore SHOULD affect the rot timer of the output.
3. Causes inventory clutter and other detriments to quality of life.

On top of that, this mod also pre-emptively applies this to several items that:
1. Might get this change applied in the future when they shouldn't.
2. Have traditionally been perishable in-game but might be subject to unexpected behavior at some point due to it (i.e. fermentation seems to preclude spoiling but only one brewable item is perishable, so abnormal behavior might arise if changes to fermentation neglect the lone exception).
3. Might warrant it for balancing reasons or misc reasons.

There are a few notable cases where I went ahead and didn't mess with things:
1. Raw dandelions. This one was hard for be to decide. There are lot of related items that are perishable, and their being perishable seems logical. But at the same time there are similar items that aren't perishable and that their non-perishable nature ALSO seems logical. I also don't really have an opinion one way or another other whether having cooked dandelion greens on demand forever is really that OP. It's easy sure, but very hard to actually establish a reliable supply.
2. Cooked acorn meal. Unlike the above case with dandelions, acorn meal now requires some extra effort to make. Without the advantage of easy preparation as in the above case, in tandem with a reliable supply of acorns being even harder to obtain than dandelions (can't farm them, no renewable tree source), it seems reasonable enough to make only the acorns non-perishable again, not the cooked acorn meal.
3. Pine nuts and shelled hickory nuts likewise will likewise slide, for consistency reasons.
4. Sweet sausage can likely get away with this as it seems to be intended as a more perishable item.
5. Most pickled goods I've left alone, as making them entails canning anyway.

If you are using Dark Days Ahead, place the included Nonperishable_Overhaul folder in your data/mods folder. If you are using the Bright Nights fork, use the Nonperishable_Overhaul_BN folder instead. In either case it is recommended that, if updating the mod, to delete the older version of the folder rather than just dumping the new one onto the old one.
